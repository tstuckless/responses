		<p>A Handmade Web is a website dedicated to talking about a ‘handmade’ website. A handmade website is a term the author created to refer to web pages coded by a single person for their own personal desires. The author also made it to help make a correlation between handmade web pages and hand made print materials. The author goes to talk about their first website they created and how they created a book which was based around the website. The author talks about how the web has evolved over the years and talks on how there is a clear different feel between the older websites and newer ones. The author talks on how websites had a lot more personality and a lot more of an amatuer feeling to it. </p>

		<p>The author finds some the advances made on the web to be problematic. The author talks on how easy it is for anyone to be able to copy the source code of almost any website by simply right clicking and inspecting element. While this is true, in my opinion, it just makes the websites that put in effort to be unique more impressive and interesting. There are so many examples out there of good and easy ways to format a website and a person can access this information at the click of a button. The author strives to push back against the corporate ways the web has inherited. While I don’t agree with everything the author says, I do agree that the internet has been taken over by a corporate template. Everything must be professional, meaning minimal, sleek, and in many cases, boring. There is some appeal in a nice professional looking website every now and then, but now there are rarely any websites that take chances in being creative and unique in their design.</p>
