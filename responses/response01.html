		<p>The Coming Age of Calm Technology is an article that talks on a term called “calm technology”. The term refers to how we are entering a relationship of ubiquitous computing. Ubiquitous computing is characterized from having computers deeply imbedded in the world and society. The author talks about the three eras that computers have had on society: The Mainframe Era, The PC Era, and The UC Era. The Mainframe era covers the era of which the trend of computers was that they were shared by multiple people, such as in an office. Mainframe computing still happens today, although it is more uncommon than it was when the article was written. The second era, the PC era, is the trend of people starting to have access to their own computers that had their own personal information on it. The third era, the UC era, goes into the trend of how in this era, that was predicted to happen in 2005 - 2030, one person would have a lot of computers. The author talked about how these computers would be different from the standard desktop computer. The next topic the author talks about is calm technology and how this technology is designed to calm and inform humans. </p>

		<p>The author is able to describe this era with a very surprising amount of accuracy to the relationship we have today with computers. The author talks predicted that technology would be built into various objects within a person’s life, such as their car, house, and clothes. The author also states that the UC will help solve big problems, such as school homework and corporate finance, to the little problems like finding your keys or a parking space. In some cities, you can see signs outside of parking lots telling you how many parking spaces available in the lot. When talking about some of the challenges with Ubiquitous Computing, the author finds that one of the most potentially interesting challenge is focusing on calm. With computers potentially being everywhere, he finds that computers need to stay out of the way and they need to be designed so the people being shared by the computers remain calm and in control. One thing I find interesting about this is the idea of self driving cars. Currently, self driving cars are being made and continuously being worked on to make them safe for mass consumption. This idea of having no control over the vehicle that a person is in directly conflicts with this idea. Although, many people are open to the idea of having the option to buy a self driving car, even though they cannot control it. Even now, more technology is being invented that is trying to help people by taking away their control. The advances of artificial intelligence over the past few years has been exponential. It will be interesting to see how the future for the UC era continues to go, as our world becomes more interconnected with computers.</p>
