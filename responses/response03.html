		<p>The video is a clip of an interview with Ted Nelson and how in its very early stages, Ted Nelson came up with a way to create a computer network. Ted Nelson is one of the internet’s pioneers. His theory relates to how a computer network could be an interconnected network where everything has connection to each other. He shows his theory through writing. He explains on how writing is connecting a bunch of thoughts into a tight sequence that can be read and understood. Ted finds this as an incorrect way of writing and saying that humanity has no good ways of showing all their thoughts. He shows his theory utilizing a slide show presentation showing the interconnections between new writings and referring to original sources. </p>

		<p>In my opinion, his theory does not make sense. Computers have such a strong ability to represent thoughts in so many different ways and an interconnected network seems to be way too complicated on a large scale. The internet already has so many ways to show your identity and express your thoughts and feelings. While having an interconnected network could be interesting to see, his theory seems overall incomplete. He has only really touched foot on showcasing the interconnections between pieces of writing. But on the internet, as it is right now, there are already so many other ways to express thoughts than just normal text. It’s hard to see this theory work out in the future, especially with the current success of the internet.</p>
